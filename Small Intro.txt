Computers and machines were always like family for me. When I was 13, I opened up a CPU out of curiosity although the consequences caused a lot of trouble to me. 
As a teenager at my school, I was the one whom the teachers and professors approached for any kind of technical help. I was the go-to guy for resolving those issues. 
Even today, nothing much has changed. Computers and phones just got replaced by the snippets of programming codes. 

I am a computer science engineering student at the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I am eager to secure challenging roles in programming and development.

My studies have provided me with broad proficiency in the use of engineering methods, tools, and techniques. Alongside this, I have developed sound communication skills while delivering presentations to large audiences at university. As such, I am confident that I can make an instant impact in engineering roles.

I am eager to hear about potential career opportunities, so I would be pleased to chat about job openings in the engineering sphere.
My key skills include Programming in C, C++, JAVA, Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Microsoft Excel. I am looking for opportunities to learn deep learning, dynamic programming, and machine learning models.

When I am not working, I generally spend my time working with various NGOs.
